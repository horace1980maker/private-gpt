# What is PrivateGPT?

**PrivateGPT** is a tool that lets you "talk" to your own documents using Artificial Intelligence (AI), but with a focus on **privacy**.

### 1. What does it do?
It works like a private version of ChatGPT. You can upload files (like PDFs, Word docs, or text files) and then ask questions about them. The AI will read your documents and give you answers based on what it found.

### 2. Why is it different?
Most AI tools send your data to the internet. PrivateGPT is different because:
*   **It stays on your computer:** Your documents never leave your machine. No one else can see them.
*   **It works offline:** You don't even need an internet connection to use it.
*   **It's 100% Private:** This makes it great for sensitive information, like medical records or legal documents.

### 3. How do you use it?
- **Web Interface:** It comes with a simple website-like screen where you can drag and drop files and start chatting.
- **For Developers:** It also has a "brain" (called an API) that other apps can talk to, allowing developers to build their own private AI tools.

### 4. Who is it for?
Anyone who wants the power of AI but needs to keep their data safe and secret.
